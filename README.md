# 🇮🇳 Indian Air Quality Analysis using Python

This project explores AQI data from five major Indian cities between 2015 and 2024.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Daily/Monthly AQI data from 2015 to 2024
- Cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze AQI trends across time and cities
- Visualize pollution patterns using histograms, heatmaps, and line plots
- Identify top contributing pollutants
- Highlight seasonal and annual variations

---

## 🛠️ Key Methods Used

- `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib` for data wrangling & visualization
- Correlation analysis
- Time-series heatmaps and trendlines
- Histogram-based AQI distribution analysis

---

## 🔍 Major Findings

- Delhi has the most severe AQI spikes, often exceeding 300+
- Mumbai maintains relatively moderate AQI
- 2020 shows an overall drop due to lockdown impact
- Pollutant correlations with AQI are generally weak but consistent per city

## 🧠 Final Insight

Urban Indian air quality is highly volatile, demanding city-specific, real-time pollution tracking and policy responses.

---

## ✨ Future Ideas

- Map AQI on an interactive dashboard
- Forecast AQI using time-series models
- Group cities by pollution patterns (clustering)
